# EasyCurve-With-Qt-Qwt
Interactive curve plotting and interpolating with Qt and Qwt.

A demo view can be found on [https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/3575844e1fcc4d2aa7e8274c1b6d3141.gif](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/3575844e1fcc4d2aa7e8274c1b6d3141.gif).

I suppose you have already install the Qt and Qwt, or you can download from:

> Qt: https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/qt/archive/online_installers/4.4/qt-unified-windows-x64-4.4.1-online.exe
> Qwt: https://udomain.dl.sourceforge.net/project/qwt/qwt/6.2.0/qwt-6.2.0.zip

I suggest you install a VS2019 firstly to provide a compilation environment for Qt and Qwt, a lower version may have some troubled I have encountered. After you have installed Qwt, remember to modify the path to qwt.lib in .pro file.
